ðŸš€ Turning Raw Data into Business Intelligence with Power BI
In todayâ€™s data-driven world, the ability to transform complex datasets into actionable insights is a skill every organization needs.
 Recently, I developed a Hotel Revenue and Bookings Analysis Dashboard in Power BI, designed to demonstrate how effective data modeling and visualization can power smarter business decisions.
ðŸ“Š Project Overview
 The dashboard integrates and analyzes hotel booking data to uncover trends in revenue performance, occupancy, and customer behavior across cities, room categories, and booking platforms.
ðŸ§© Data Modelling Approach
 To ensure accuracy and scalability, I built a Star Schema Model that included:
Fact Tables: fact_bookings, fact_aggregated_bookings
Dimension Tables: dim_rooms, dim_hotels, dim_date
 I applied hashtag#DAX measures to calculate metrics like revenue per available room, occupancy rates, average daily rate, and cancellations â€” enabling dynamic insights through well-structured relationships.
ðŸ’¡ Key Findings:
hashtag#Total Revenue: 1.7 Billion
hashtag#Occupancy Rate: 58%
hashtag#Average Rating: 3.62
hashtag#TopRoom Class: Elite (37% of bookings)
hashtag#Leading City: Mumbai
Most Active Platform: hashtag#MakeMyTrip (55K bookings)
ðŸŽ¯ Dashboard Features:
Interactive slicers for room class, city, hotel category, and booking channel.
Visuals for revenue by class, city, and platform.
Comprehensive KPI cards for performance tracking.
Analytical summary table for comparative performance metrics.
This project highlights my strengths in:
 âœ… Data Modelling & DAX Calculations
 âœ… Data Visualization & Storytelling
 âœ… Transforming Business Data into Decision Support Tools

Open to Collaborations
 Iâ€™m always open to opportunities to apply these skills in real-world projects â€” whether in data analysis, business intelligence, or Power BI development.
 If youâ€™re looking to turn your organizationâ€™s data into insights that drive growth, Iâ€™d love to collaborate!
